# Prettify-Content-by-Label
## What is this?
A quick script which reformats Atlassian Confluence's  Content by Label macro to look like the Child Pages macro.
## Why does it matter?
This helps me (and, maybe, other Confluence authors) keep a space page tree organized in a sensible way, but still have pages which can direct people to a variety of other pages in a way which relies on system tools. This avoids manual work, and I think it looks pretty good too.
